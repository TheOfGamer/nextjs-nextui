## Next.JS & Next.UI 
### Example app

I've created this repo as start point for all my projects, maybe that repo will help you too.

This app contains:
```
React
Next.JS 
(Page folder & JavaScript lang)
Next.UI
```

## Installation guide
To clone this app just download repo contents from GitHub.

After extracting app to directory write
 `npm init` to edit app details.

After installation run `npm run dev` and open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `page/index.js`. 

Have fun!
